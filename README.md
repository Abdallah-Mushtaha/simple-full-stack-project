-My Journey in Learning Backend and Building a Medical Clinic Management System 🏥💡
I've always been interested in user interface design, as that was my area of ​​expertise as a frontend developer. But this time, I decided to take the backend approach for myself.
💡 What did I accomplish in the project?
✅ Building a medical clinic management system from scratch, making it easy to use and responsive across all devices using Bootstrap.
✅ Designing databases for the first time, creating tables for doctors, pharmacists, and patients, ensuring the data was organized and easy to manage.
✅ Implementing CRUD (add, edit, delete data) operations to make the system dynamic and easy to update.
✅ Focusing on developing the backend to ensure efficient performance and speedy data processing, while maintaining simple, straightforward, and purposeful interfaces.
✅ Practical integration of the frontend and backend, while improving server performance and database management.

🛠 Technologies we used:
🔹 PHP
🔹 MySQL
🔹 HTML & CSS
🔹 Bootstrap
🔹 The experience was very fun and full of learning! 🔥 It wasn't just theoretical learning, but practical application that helped me understand backend more deeply.🚀
